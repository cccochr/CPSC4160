Project no: Project 5

Project due date: December 3, 2017

Project description: Added 3 player channels through which player will be able to move through. Fixed W and S to move up and down through all three channels. Fixed evade so that SmartTwoWayMultiSprite would evade the player by one channel. Added new custom background with corresponding channel sizes. Implemented a jump feature for player and fixed it where the player jumps but stays in the same channel that they were in originally. Jump is attached to the space bar. Integrated painter's algorith so that the uppermost channel is also the one farthest to the back. This adds a feeling of depth to the player.

The easiest part of this project: Drawing the new background

Problems that I had in completing this project: Jump feature took 4 hours to complete.
